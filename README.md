# MNIST-classification
Project: Constructing Different Neural Networks from First Principles to Classify Digits

Objective: To gain a fundamental understanding of how basic neural networks work.

Tasks:
Creating and training a full forward neural network to classify handwritten digits.
Specifically I will be:
- Creating the neural network with classes
- Implementing back propogation to optimise model performance
- Opitimsing performance with parameters including
    - number of layers in the network
    - number of perceptrons in each layer
    - dynamically adjusting the learning rate
    - stopping learning early to minimise overfitting

Data: The data I will be using is the MNIST data set containing hand written digits http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
